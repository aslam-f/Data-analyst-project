# General Business Analytics — Sample Project

**Project name:** Business Analytics — Sales, Billing & Resource Dashboard  
**Overview:** This is a synthetic dataset and project scaffold designed to showcase end-to-end data analytics skills (SQL, Python, Power BI/Excel). The data simulates orders, billing, project and resource billing details.

**Files included:**

- `file_structure.txt` — Recommended GitHub structure

**Suggested workflow:**
1. Inspect dataset using SQL (import CSV into a SQL environment or create a table).
2. Run `analysis.py` to reproduce EDA and charts (requires pandas and matplotlib).
3. Build Power BI dashboard using CSV as data source. Key pages: Overview (KPIs), Sales by Region/Product, Billing & AR, Resource Utilization.

**Key KPIs to highlight:**
- Total Revenue, Cost, Profit
